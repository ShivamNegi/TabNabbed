        The extension offers security from tabnabbing. 

        Tabnabbing is a form of phishing where malicious websites exploit the lack of focus of their website to completely change their look and feel to imitate the log-in page of a benign site. The key idea of tabnabbing is that users are trained to carefully inspect a website when they first open it, but once it's open, it is lost in a "sea of tabs". When users come back to the open site (that now may look like the login page of Paypal or GMail) they do not inspect the browser URL but assume that Gmail/Paypal has logged them out and proceed to log-in again, thereby leaking their credentials to the attacker.
